This repository is hosting the documentation for the WP6 related work. 

The loose collection of files, written in [Markdown](), is compiled to a website using [gitbooks]() hosted via [GitHub Pages]() under a [Creative Commons licence]()

[cascade_wp6.github.io]()

You can add pages to the book by 

- cloning the repository, 
- adding a Markdown document and linking it in the SUMMARY.md file
- pushing the repository to GitHub (given that you are a registered member of WP6 on GitHub). 

Please make sure that you write valid Markdown, e.g. by using a Markdown editor with live preview such as [MarkdownPad2]().
