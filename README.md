CASCADE Workpackage 6 | Modelling
=================================

This repository is hosting the documentation for the WP6 related work.

The loose collection of files, written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), is compiled to a website using [gitbook](http://www.gitbook.io/) hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages) under a [Creative Commons licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

### Contribute 

If you are a member of the GitHub group *cascade-wp6*, you can simply use the Button **Edit and Contribute** to modify the content of any chapter. You just need to be logged in with your GitHub account (given that you are a registered member of WP6 on GitHub). 

You can add pages to the book by

1. cloning the repository,
2. adding a Markdown document and linking it in the SUMMARY.md file
3. pushing the repository to GitHub 

Please make sure that you write valid Markdown, e.g. by using a Markdown editor with live preview such as [MarkdownPad2](), [RStudio](www.rstudio.com) or [GitBook editor](https://github.com/GitbookIO/editor). The latter also provides a preview of the website.

The pages will not rebuild automatically. This will be done manually by Flo Schneider. [Read more about that here](https://github.com/cascade-wp6/wp6_docs/wiki)
