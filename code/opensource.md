# Open source

The idea of open source code development is that the public has full access to the computer code of a project. Scientific simulation code usually is not very general and has one very particular use: it runs a model simulation with a fix parameter set-up.

Still, providing it to scientific peers allows to reproduce the research, review it for consistency, build upon what was done by others.

Because of limited funding and the importance of renom√©e, todays research is undeniably competitive. That is why the open source idea is often seen incompatible with scientific code development. Often, a too strict notion of intellectual property hinders collaborative code development or review and leaves bugs and logical errors unnoticed.

That is why we chose an intermediate way:
- the code development is semi-private in the pre-publishing phase, sharing code only with invited reviewers and partners to enable a review and debate.
- after article publication, the simulation code is made available along with the paper or on public repositories on the internet.


## Licensing

One common prejudice of Open Source is that the code, once published, is not controllable anymore and everyone can use and re-publish it for an own benefit. That is not true if the published work is put under a legal licence.

Different schemes of licensing do exist to protect the rights of the author. For computer code the most common License is the [GNU public license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html) which allows others to adapt your work for own projects as long as they publish it under the same terms. Often, Universities prefer a more liberal licensing that allows the re-use for commercial and non-open-source projects (e.g. MIT License). Anyway, if code is made public, the terms of use must be announced by refering to the [license of choice](http://choosealicense.com/).

Text, such as manuscripts or documentation (such as this website) can also be licensed, preferably under a [Creative Commons International License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/). This License covers any creative work such as Videos or Powerpoint slides, but also database content.
