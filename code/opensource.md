# Open source

The idea of open source code development is that the public has full access to the computer code of a project. Scientific simulation code usually is not very general and has one very particular use: it runs a model simulation with a fix parameter set-up.

Still, providing it to scientific peers allows to reproduce the research, review it for consistency, build upon what was done by others.

Because of limited funding and the importance of renom√©e, todays research is undeniably competitive. That is why the open source idea is often seen incompatible with scientific code development. Often, a too strict notion of intellectual property hinders collaborative code development or review and leaves bugs and logical errors unnoticed.

That is why we chose an intermediate way:
- the code development is semi-private in the pre-publishing phase, sharing code only with invited reviewers and partners to enable a review and debate.
- after article publication, the simulation code is made available along with the paper or on public repositories on the internet.


## Licensing

One common prejudice of Open Source is that the code, once published, is not controllable anymore and everyone can use and re-publish it for an own benefit. That is not true if the published work is put under a legal licence.

Different schemes of licensing do exist to protect the rights of the author. For computer code the most common License is the [GNU public license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html) which allows others to adapt your work for own projects as long as they publish it under the same terms. For every project, you should announce the terms of use by refering to the [license of choice](http://choosealicense.com/).

Text, such as manuscripts or documentation (such as this website) can also be licensed, preferably under a [Creative Commons License](https://creativecommons.org/choose/).


## GitHub facilitates Open Source research

GitHubs has a very [supportive research policy](https://github.com/blog/1840-improving-github-for-science) and provides non-commercial research and educational projects with [free-of-charge private repositories](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new). As an individual researcher you can apply as well for your own projects.

Thus all the useful features of GitHub are available to our ongoing projects within the WP6 team. And we can liberally choose between private or public development.

- **publish code**: hosting your code for the public, get a DOI for your code
- **collaboratively work on code**: review and develop
- **manage code development**: use issue tracking and set milestones
- **choose a license**: select from many possible licensing schemes for code or text
- **documentation**: keep a wiki alongside with your research project, see the version history of the project
