# Code Development under Quality control

The workpackage 6 of CASCADE develops model formulations of dryland ecosystems which are investigated in computer simulations.

That means, besides the classical research output such as articles in peer-review journals, it produces computer code that was used for the scientific investigation. Naturally, the code files include the complete description of the model, though not necessarily in a human-readable style.

We aim to install a quality control scheme in our research by [documenting the project](documentation.md) as well as the [progress of the code development](versioncontrol.md) and by [providing the code along with the scientific publication](opensource.md).
