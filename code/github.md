# Using GitHub for research projects

In the first place, GitHub is a webserver for Open Source projects. It stores, visualises and helps to manage projects that develop some kind of computer code. Of course everything on GitHub is under *git* version control.

To participate actively in the code development in WP6 [you will need a GitHub account](https://github.com/), which is completely free (no adds, no personal data trade).

Then, you should join the CASCADE WP6 team at [github.com/cascade-wp6](https://github.com/cascade-wp6) which gives you access to the private repositories. Now, you also can

- create your own (private or public) repositories and push your own projects to GitHub.
- invite other partners within CASCADE or attached to CASCADE to participate in your project.
- comment on other projects going on within CASCADE and get the code.

GitHub provides a couple of features for [project management](opensource.md)(Milestones and issue tracking) and [documentation](documentation.md) (Wikis and Version history).

## GitHub facilitates Open Source research

GitHubs has a very [supportive research policy](https://github.com/blog/1840-improving-github-for-science) and provides non-commercial research and educational projects with [free-of-charge private repositories](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new). As an individual researcher you can apply as well for your own projects.

Thus all the useful features of GitHub are available to our ongoing projects within the WP6 team. And we can liberally choose between private or public development.

## Overview:

- **publish code**: hosting your code for the public, get a DOI for your code
- **collaboratively work on code**: review and develop
- **manage code development**: use issue tracking and set milestones
- **choose a license**: select from many possible licensing schemes for code or text
- **documentation**: keep a wiki alongside with your research project, record the version history and solved issues of the project
