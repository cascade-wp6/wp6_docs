# Projects

The work in CASCADE workpackage 6 is in progress. No projects were finalized yet with a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Here is an overview of the intended publications and the approaches they are using.

## Work in progress

### Spatially explicit grazing and spatial vegetation structure

The state of the art in spatial modelling of vegetation structure reduces plant mortality due to grazing to a constant parameter. This means, all plants have the same risk of being grazed, regardless of their local neighborhood conditions or the total density of plants in the landscape.

This project incorporates a spatially explicit definition of grazing risk into an cellular automaton to add a second spatial component besides the local facilitation.

### Fire succession


### Nursing in arid environments: positive spatial feed-backs on plant establishment



## Further intended projects

### Modelling spatial explicit livestock effects

### Social-ecological dynamics of livestock grazing



## Finished projects
