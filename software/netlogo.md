# Netlogo: hands-on modelling

The Netlogo platform is well established for agent-based models. It is useful to visualise, explore and teach the behaviour of certain models.

Cellular automata are a sub-set of agent-based models and can be modelled in Netlogo.

Implementations of ]the models developed within CASCADE are available for Netlogo](https://github.com/cascade-wp6/netlogo_models). Just download and install [the latest version of NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml), then launch the program and open (File/open) one of the `.nlogo` files.

Coding in Netlogo is quite different.
The standardised structure of a Netlogo program is split in three parts: The Screen, the Documentation and the Definitions.

The **screen** can be organised by click-and-point. Just draw and move the windows, edit the content or size. Any rulers inserted here will be available as variables in the definitions. Any parameters defined in the definitions can be called here to plot dynamic figures.

The **definitions** will require coding. Read the manual.

The **documentation** suggests certain categories that should be provided to explain users what the model represents, what it's purpose is, what are the assumptions, as well as suggestions for its exploration (what to try) and a License.
