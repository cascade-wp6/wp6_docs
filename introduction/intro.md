# General Information

The [CASCADE project](introduction/cascade.md) is a research project on catastrophic shifts in drylands in the Mediterranean region. 

[Catastrophic shifts](introduction/shifts.md) are sudden changes of the ecosystems state as a response to a continously increasing pressure or a disturbance event. 

CASCADE searches for early indicators for these critical tipping points and aims at the development of response strategies for farmers and land managers. [The task of WP6](introduction/objectives.md) within CASCADE is to develop models that mimic the complex dynamics in the mediterranean drylands to investigate the responses to multiple pressures, and to develop indicators. 

To achieve that for the whole range of different ecosystems, we are applying different [modelling  approaches](introduction/approaches.md).
