# Introduction

The [CASCADE project](http://www.cascade-project.eu/) is a research project on catastrophic shifts in drylands in the Mediterranean region. 

Catastrophic shifts are sudden changes of the ecosystems state as a response to a continously increasing pressure or a disturbance event. In the Mediterranean region, as well as in other arid and semi-arid regions of the world, these drivers include drought, grazing and recurring wildfires. 

In these systems, the response of the ecosystem is discontinous because positive feed-back mechanisms change the attractor of the ecosysem after a certain threshold, or tipping-point, is crossed. For instance, while over years the vegetation can sustain under the continous grazing pressure, it might collapse within very short time once the number of grazers reaches a threshold that triggers self-enhancing erosion processes. 

CASCADE searches for early indicators for these critical tipping points and aims at the development of response strategies for farmers and land managers. 

The task of WP6 within CASCADE is to develop models that mimic the complex dynamics in the mediterranean drylands to investigate the responses to multiple pressures, and to develop indicators. 

CASCADE is funded by the European Union.
